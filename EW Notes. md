# Electronic Warfare (EW) â€“ Basic Concepts

## What is Electronic Warfare?

Electronic Warfare (EW) is the strategic use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) to:
- Attack an enemy
- Protect yourself
- Support operations

EW is generally divided into **three categories**:

### 1. Electronic Attack (EA)
- Use of electromagnetic energy to **deny, degrade, or destroy** enemy systems.
- Examples: Jamming enemy radars, spoofing GPS signals.

### 2. Electronic Protection (EP)
- Measures taken to **protect your systems** from enemy electronic attacks.
- Examples: Frequency hopping, shielding, encryption.

### 3. Electronic Support (ES)
- Using sensors to **detect, identify, and locate** enemy signals.
- Examples: Radar detection, signal interception.

## Real-World Applications

- Military communication security
- Radar evasion and jamming
- Drone and aircraft defense systems

## Tools and Technologies

- Software-defined radios (SDRs)
- Direction-finding antennas
- Signal analysis tools (e.g., GNU Radio)

## Ethics & Legality

This project is educational. Unauthorized signal interference is **illegal and unethical**.
