# # Electronic Warfare Toolkit

This project aims to explore the principles, technologies, and simulation tools used in **Electronic Warfare (EW)**. The goal is to build a research-based, modular platform to understand how electronic attacks, protection, and support are implemented in modern defense systems.

## Project Objectives

- Simulate basic Electronic Attack (EA) and Electronic Protection (EP) techniques.
- Analyze RF signal patterns and interference strategies.
- Build tools for signal jamming, spoofing, and detection (simulation-only).
- Educate and demonstrate EW concepts for academic or training use.

## Features (Planned)

- **RF Signal Generator/Analyzer**
- **Jamming Technique Simulator**
- **Signal Detection and Classification Tool**
- **Data Visualization Dashboard**

## Getting Started

This is a conceptual and educational project. No real-world jamming or interference will be implemented.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy
- Optional: GNU Radio or SDR simulation libraries

### Installation (Coming Soon)

Instructions for setting up the environment and running basic modules will be added here.

## Contribution

We welcome suggestions, educational use cases, and collaboration on simulations, algorithms, or visualizations.
